# Vanilla-Packs-Plus
A detailed version of Minecraft Bedrock's Vanilla Packs.

This is an open source add-on for Minecraft Bedrock Edition for add-on creators. It aims to imitate certain features (such as blocks and items) from the game that aren't in the official vanilla packs. It's meant to save time to add-on developers, so you are able to download all the code that you need. When using this code, you can give credit, or not, that's at your choice!

You are welcome to contribute with this project.
